MicroTeams is a web conferencing system built under Microsoft Engage'21 programe.
MicroTeams provides you all the core features you would expect from a commercial web conferencing system. It is built from a collection of Open Source projects (Jitsi, Jibri, JVB, Jigasi etc.) which provide state-of-the-art video conferencing capabilities that are secure and easy to use.

## Designed for a complete experience

MicroTeams extends many of its core features to focus on enabling the instructor to engage students. There are four main use cases for engagement:

* Tutoring/virtual office hours
* Flipped classroom
* Group collaboration
* Full online classes

If you are an instructor, MicroTeams helps you engage students with:

* Multi-user whiteboard (still under progress)
* Breakout rooms (group and individual)
* Chat (public and private)
* Shared notes and docs
* Randomly selecting a student
* Emojis

We think of engagement in terms of activities designed to help students learn, such as following the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom's_taxonomy">Bloomâ€™s Taxonomy</a> framework. Examples include an activity that causes the user to recall (such as answering a poll), demonstrate (such as using multi-user whiteboard), apply (such as in breakout rooms), or ask questions (such as using public chat) about the material the instructor is trying to teach. The more students are engaged, the more they are thinking and learning.

## A brief overview of MicroTeams

There are two types of users in MicroTeams: viewer and moderator.

* A <b>viewer</b> (typically a person who joins the call) can chat, send/receive audio and video, respond to polls, display an emoji (such as their raised hand), and participate in a breakout sessions. They can not affect other students in the class.

* A <b>moderator</b> (typically a person who creates the call) can do everything a viewer can, plus more. A moderator can mute/unmute other viewers, lock down viewers (such as restrict them from using private chat), make any user (including themselves) the current presenter, and start breakout rooms. There can be multiple moderators in a session.

The presenter is an extra layer of privileges that gives any user the ability to

* Upload slides
* Share a YouTube, vimeo, peertube, or Canvas Studio video
* Live stream on Youtube
* Share their screen
* Record the session
* Mute/Unmute the Viewers

There can be only one presenter at a time. Again, any moderator can make any user (including themselves) the current presenter.
